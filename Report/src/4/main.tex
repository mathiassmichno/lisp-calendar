\chapter{Sources of Inspiration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item During development I browsed the Racket documentation, which influenced several appoaches in the program.\\
        One of these is; the use of local name--binding of a lambda which can the be evaluated from within it self, hereby eliminating the need for external helper functions when e.g. making tail--recursive functions.\\
        Moreover the Racket documentation and its use of EBNF to present syntax, helped me with using pattern matching among other concepts.
    \item A group member of mine, pointed me in the direction of the MINIX implementation of gmtime, which heavily influenced my implementation of Unix timestamp conversion. The source code for the MINIX gmtime can be found here \url{http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~cop4600/cgi-bin/lxr/http/source.cgi/lib/ansi/gmtime.c}
